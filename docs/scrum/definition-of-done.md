# Definition of Done

An Increment is "Done" when ALL criteria are met:

## Quality

- [ ] Implementation works as intended
- [ ] No known defects introduced
- [ ] Follows project conventions (SKILL.md YAML frontmatter, agent definition format)

## Testing

- [ ] Skill can be installed via `/scrum install` (symlink created)
- [ ] Skill loads correctly in Claude Code (YAML frontmatter valid)
- [ ] Manual verification documented in sprint log

## Transparency

- [ ] Changes committed to git with descriptive message
- [ ] PR updated or created for stakeholder review
- [ ] Sprint log updated with what was done and why

## Scrum

- [ ] Acceptance criteria from backlog item are met
- [ ] Increment is usable (not half-finished)

# Definition of Done

An Increment is "Done" when ALL criteria are met:

## Quality

- [ ] Implementation works as intended
- [ ] No known defects introduced
- [ ] Follows project conventions

## Testing

- [ ] {Adapt to project -- detect and replace with concrete checks:}
  - pyproject.toml with pytest → "pytest passes"
  - package.json with jest/vitest → "npm test passes"
  - Cargo.toml → "cargo test passes"
  - No test framework detected → "Manual verification documented in review.md"
  - ruff detected → "ruff check passes"
  - eslint detected → "eslint passes"

## Transparency

- [ ] Changes are documented (what and why)
- [ ] Stakeholder can understand what was delivered

## Scrum

- [ ] Acceptance criteria from backlog item are met
- [ ] Increment is usable (not half-finished)

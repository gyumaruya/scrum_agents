# Scrum Values

These are behavioral requirements, not aspirations.

## Commitment

- Deliver on the Sprint Goal
- If the goal is at risk, communicate immediately
- Every retrospective produces at least one concrete change

## Focus

- Work on the Sprint Goal, nothing else
- New desires go to the backlog, not the current sprint
- One goal at a time

## Openness

- State what you don't know
- Share failures and problems immediately
- Never hide behind vague language

## Respect

- PO decides what and why. Dev decides how. SM facilitates improvement.
- Do not override another role's domain
- Trust stakeholder desires even when vague -- translate, don't dismiss

## Courage

- Change organizational files when evidence demands it
- Raise problems mid-sprint
- Pivot when the approach isn't working
- Proactively discover and address problems -- don't wait to be asked
- Suggest improvements even when things seem to be working

# Definition of Done

An Increment is "Done" when ALL of the following are true:

## Quality

- [ ] Code/config works as intended (tested or verified)
- [ ] No known defects introduced
- [ ] Follows project conventions (if any exist)

## Transparency

- [ ] Changes are documented (what changed and why)
- [ ] Decisions and assumptions are stated
- [ ] Stakeholder can understand what was delivered

## Scrum

- [ ] Acceptance criteria from Product Backlog item are met
- [ ] Increment is usable (not half-finished)

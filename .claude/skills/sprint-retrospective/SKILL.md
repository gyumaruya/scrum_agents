# Sprint Retrospective

Run a Sprint Retrospective to inspect the process and adapt the organization.

## When to Use

- After completing a meaningful increment
- When the user or SM agent detects process issues
- User says "振り返り", "レトロ", "retrospective"

## Process

1. **Gather Data**
   - What was the Sprint Goal?
   - What was delivered?
   - What happened during the sprint?

2. **Generate Insights**
   - What went well? (keep doing)
   - What didn't go well? (stop or change)
   - What was surprising? (investigate)

3. **Decide Actions**
   - Select the MOST IMPACTFUL improvement
   - Make it concrete: what file to change, what rule to add/modify

4. **Execute Changes**
   - Actually update CLAUDE.md, skills, agent definitions, or rules
   - Do not just recommend -- make the change

5. **Record**
   - Save retrospective to `.claude/docs/sprint-history/sprint-{N}.md`
   - Increment sprint number based on existing history

## Important

- At least ONE concrete change must result from every retrospective
- Changes are committed to Git (organizational learning history)
- Focus on the most impactful issue, not all issues
- Frame as team learning, not blame

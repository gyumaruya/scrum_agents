# Sprint Planning

Plan a Sprint by defining the Sprint Goal and Sprint Backlog.

## When to Use

- Stakeholder expresses a new desire or goal
- Starting work on a new initiative
- User says "計画", "プランニング", "sprint planning"

## Process

1. **Understand the "Why"**
   - What does the Stakeholder want?
   - What value will this deliver?
   - PO agent translates desire into Product Backlog items (if not already done)

2. **Define the Sprint Goal**
   - Craft a single, clear objective
   - The goal answers: "Why is this Sprint valuable?"
   - Must be achievable within the sprint

3. **Select Backlog Items**
   - Choose items from Product Backlog that serve the Sprint Goal
   - Developer agent assesses feasibility
   - Only select what can realistically be completed

4. **Plan the Work**
   - Developer agent breaks selected items into implementation steps
   - Identify risks and unknowns
   - Define what "Done" looks like for each item

## Output

Sprint Planning produces:
- **Sprint Goal**: One clear sentence
- **Sprint Backlog**: Selected items with implementation plan
- **Risks**: Known unknowns and mitigation approaches

## Important

- PO owns the "what" and "why"
- Developer owns the "how" and "how much"
- Sprint Goal provides focus -- all work should serve it
- It's OK to have unknowns -- flag them, don't ignore them

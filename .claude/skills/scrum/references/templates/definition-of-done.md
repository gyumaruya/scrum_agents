# Definition of Done

An Increment is "Done" when ALL criteria are met:

## Quality

- [ ] Implementation works as intended
- [ ] No known defects introduced
- [ ] Follows project conventions

## Testing

- [ ] {Adapt to project: e.g., "pytest passes" / "npm test passes" / "manual verification documented"}

## Transparency

- [ ] Changes are documented (what and why)
- [ ] Stakeholder can understand what was delivered

## Scrum

- [ ] Acceptance criteria from backlog item are met
- [ ] Increment is usable (not half-finished)

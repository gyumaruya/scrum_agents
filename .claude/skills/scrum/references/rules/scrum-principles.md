# Scrum Principles

This project practices Scrum. All agent behavior follows these principles.

## Three Pillars of Empiricism

### Transparency

- All work, decisions, and assumptions are visible
- State uncertainty openly: "I don't know X, my assumption is Y"
- Product Backlog is the single source of truth

### Inspection

- Frequently inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal
- Detect problems early, before they compound
- Every increment is reviewed against the Definition of Done

### Adaptation

- When inspection reveals problems, adapt immediately
- Do not wait for a ceremony to fix obvious issues
- After each sprint, retrospective findings become concrete file changes

## Self-Management

The agent team decides:
- **What** to work on (PO translates stakeholder desires)
- **When** to deliver (Sprint boundaries are goal-based)
- **How** to work (Dev chooses implementation approach)
- **How to improve** (SM runs retrospectives)

The stakeholder (user) provides direction, not commands.

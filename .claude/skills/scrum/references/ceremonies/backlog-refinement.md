# Backlog Refinement

## When

- Between sprints
- New stakeholder desires emerge mid-sprint (add to backlog, don't disrupt sprint)
- Manual: `/scrum refine`

## Process

### 1. Review

Read `docs/scrum/backlog.md`.

### 2. Refine

Spawn `scrum-product-owner` agent to:
- Add detail to top items (acceptance criteria)
- Remove stale items
- Re-order by value
- Split large items
- Add new items from stakeholder desires

### 3. Present

Show updated backlog briefly. Ask if priorities are correct.

### 4. Write

Update `docs/scrum/backlog.md`.

## Output

Updated backlog summary. Top 3 items ready for next sprint.

# Daily Scrum

## When

- Mid-sprint progress check
- When you want to inspect and adapt
- User says "進捗", "daily", "どうなってる"

## Process

### 1. Read Current State

Read `.claude/scrum/current-sprint.md` to understand:
- Sprint Goal
- Item statuses (pending/in_progress/done/blocked)
- Any logged blockers

### 2. Inspect

For each in-progress item:
- What progress has been made?
- Is it on track to complete?
- Are there any blockers?

### 3. Adapt

If problems are detected:
- Reorder remaining work
- Drop items if Sprint Goal is at risk (keep the goal, reduce scope)
- Flag blockers for immediate resolution

### 4. Update Sprint File

Update `.claude/scrum/current-sprint.md`:
- Item status changes
- Add log entry with today's date
- Note any adaptations made

## Output

Brief status in Japanese:
- Sprint Goal progress (on track / at risk / blocked)
- Items done / in progress / remaining
- Any adaptations made
- What happens next

## Next Step

Continue development. If increment is ready, suggest `/scrum review`.
